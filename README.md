# writeups-PortsWigger-Labs


WriteUps of the public labs inside the free [Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-path) made available by [PortsWigger](https://portswigger.net/). Mostly solved with `bash` scripts.

**Disclaymer ⚠️**
- I am only a guy who has solved some of the public labs from [PortsWigger](https://portswigger.net/) who I am fully grateful to allow anyone can learn and practice for free.
- I dont have any relationship with  [PortsWigger](https://portswigger.net/) other than a student of the free [Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-path).
- Since the labs are public and even they show the solution using [BurpSuit](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload) I want to share how I solve them mostly with `bash` scripts.
